The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is one of the key components for forming images in electronic devices. These items are heavy, which may sag over time and put pressure on the motherboard. If the motherboard is damaged, it can cost a lot of money to fix. this GPU brace could hold the GPU in place. Save yourself from trouble with our amazing GPU braces, a Vertical (10.6 inches tall) GPU Support Brace Support Dual Construction with Aluminum and ABS Material which height could be adjusted.

,
Universal VGA Holder If you are looking for a branded graphics card sag holder then this Universal VGA Holder fits the bill perfectly. the two supporters here are made of ps+ABS plastic and have a friction locking mechanism where you just have to push the clip inside to lock the support arms. This locking mechanism is relatively easy and quicker than compared to the tool-less screw ones in the upHere one. With pretty strong magnet The bar and the stand are made of aluminum and is very stable.

,
This vertical graphics card holder can support two graphics cards in a multi-GPU setup (SLI or CrossFire). Graphics Card Holder comes with two bars, and you can either use one or two at the same time, depending on the height of the graphics card from the base. This means if you have a smaller case then you are good with one bar only, but if the case is big then you can join the two bars together to extend its length so that it can reach the graphics card. It is only available in black color.
